# Local Filters

Local filters are great for quickly prototyping, or for personal filters that belong to a single project.

Local filters are very easy to implement, all you need to do is to write a filter in one of the languages supported by Regolith and define the filter definition in the {ref}`config.json<project-config-file>` file. You can read more about it in the {ref}`Local Filter Definition<local-filter-definition>` section of the Filter Definition page.

If you want to learn by example, you can check out the {ref}`Create Local Filter Tutorial<create-local-filter-tutorial>`.
