# Local Filters
Local filters are ideal for rapid prototyping or creating personal filters tailored to a specific project.

They are simple to implement: write a program in one of the languages supported by Regolith and define the filter in the project's {ref}`config.json<project-config-file>` file. For detailed instructions, see the {ref}`Local Filter Definition<local-filter-definition>` section on the Filter Definition page.

If you want to learn by example, you can check out the {ref}`Create Local Filter Tutorial<create-local-filter-tutorial>`.
